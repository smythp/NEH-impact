	"EEBO contains over 100,000 early English book titles, including incunabula, reflected in bibliographies such as the English Short Title Catalogue, Pollard & Redgrave’s Short-Title Catalogue and Wing’s Short-Title Catalogue.",
	"According to librarian Diana Kichuk, EEBO must be considered a highly processed historical artifact. Kichuk writes that EEBO preserves the limitations of microfilm—the cropping, poor registration, and low microfilm image granularity—while adding the strengths and limitations unique to the digital medium—the convenience and added value of digital access as well as the erosion of detail. Similarly, book historian Ian Gadd says that it is necessary to understand the limitations of EEBO. Gadd says that in an EEBO book, the ink can be any color so long as it’s black: there is no red, no gold. An EEBO book usually has no outside; only very rarely are bindings included. EEBO books appear at first to be a uniform size, regardless of the book’s original size. And, that a user of EEBO needs to be conscious of the resource’s history, the limitations of its coverage, the origins of its bibliographical data, and the nature of the relationship between its bibliographical catalogue and the individual copies available.

	Search

	Because books are digitized in EEBO as images, it is not possible to search their text directly (except for users who have institutional membership of EEBO-TCP). Instead, most searches are performed on the bibliographic information.

	EEBO-TCP

	About a quarter of the files in EEBO have been converted into searchable text through an initiative called the Text Creation Partnership. EEBO-TCP started in 1999 and aimed at converting a portion of the image files of EEBO books into ASCII text. Phase one resulted in the conversion of 25,000 titles into TEI-compliant, SGML/XML texts. EEBO-TCP is an initiative of Oxford University, ProQuest, and the University of Michigan. Phase two will convert the remaining works. One hundred and fifty member libraries fund the project.

	Downloading EEBO files

	Books in EEBO can be downloaded in their entirety or one page at a time. However, there may soon be a new way of accessing some of the full-text. The 25,000 texts created by EEBO-TCP are free to the public as of January 2015.

	Spelling

	EEBO text has famously variant spellings and formats. Helpfully, EEBO allows users to type in one spelling and check to see if other spellings were used and have those reflected in the search results. The EEBO-TCP N-gram Browser allows a scholar to check the frequency with which terms appear in EEBO using multiple spellings. A graduate student created the EEBO-TCP N-gram Browser to assist in text analysis. Click on the Conversations tab to learn more about this tool.",
