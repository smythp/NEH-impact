# NEH Impact Index

Web app for looking up NEH-funded projects at institutions in an area.

The test.db is a sqlite database provided for testing. It only has info for one ZIP code. To build a database similar to the one used for the live site, run the script in [this repository](https://github.com/smythp/neh-impact-build-database).
