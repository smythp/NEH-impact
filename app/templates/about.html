<h1>About</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> is an independent federal agency that supports humanities projects and initiatives, including those for education, historical preservation, and public-facing scholarship. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/03/16/520379061/read-president-trumps-budget-blueprint">Recent budget proposals</a> allocate zero funding to the NEH, an extreme stance that disregards the local impact of the agency and its role in preserving and advancing American culture and scholarship.</p>

<p>The NEH Impact Index makes visible the impact of the NEH on local communities and cultural institutions. <a href="/index">Enter a zipcode and search radius</a> to find projects funded by the NEH in that area. Projects are color-coded into categories such as public-facing scholarship, education, and preservation to show the type of impact each grant has in that area and in the wider community.</p>

<p>The NEH Impact Index was created as part of an effort by <a href="https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">Graduate Center Digital Initiatives (GCDI)</a> as part of an ongoing effort to show the broad impact of the NEH, not only in the humanities but in the wider culture. The Digital Fellows, an interdisciplinary group of graduate students led by <a href="https://twitter.com/mkgold">Matthew K. Gold</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lmrhody">Lisa M. Rhody</a> is undertaking a variety of approaches to underscore the value of organizations such as the NEH.  This site was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/psmyth01">Patrick Smyth</a>, a <a href="https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">GC Digital Fellow</a> and graduate student in English at the Graduate Center.</p>
